My portfolio and blog site. Built with Jekyll and friends.

## About Nate Green

I'm a user experience designer with a background in visual design. I've learned enough about front-end code that I can hack away at my own site, but not much more than that.

Feel free to poke around my code. It's probably kind of messy...remember, I'm a designer. Don't judge me too harshly.

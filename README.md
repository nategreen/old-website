I'm a user experience designer with a background in visual design. This is my portfolio and blog site. It's a work in progress, I'm trying to continually make commits that improve the site's style and features, but keep the site up and running without breaking anything. (So if you see something broken, open an issue or [email me](mailto:heynategreen@gmail.com).)

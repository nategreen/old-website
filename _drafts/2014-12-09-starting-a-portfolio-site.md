title: "Assessing My Skills & Strengths"

---

I just finished up the "UXD in Practice" course at Kent State---a broad overview of techniques and deliverables employed by UX designers. For our final project, we designed the beginnings of a portfolio site using the deliverables we'd learned about in class: concept maps, site maps, process flows, and wireframes.

## Assessing my skills, strengths & weaknesses

Included in our assignment for the week was a skills assessment, even though we weren't required to show it to anyone.

## Creating a map of my concept model

Reading through [our textbook](portfolio-book) and [several](lynn-teo) [professionals'](david-travis) [thoughts](quora-portfolios) on the subject, it's clear that a UX designer's portfolio should meet these requirements *at least*:

- Show the process *and* the results
- Show your best work
- Get the main ideas across to "land the job" very quickly (less than 1 minute), but also allow for further scrutiny
- Demonstrate desirable qualities in the design of the site: attention to detail, excellent thinking skills, meet user goals and business objectives

With those things in mind, I started sketching a concept map of the ideas surrounding portfolios, design, and my career.

### Listing out all my ideas

I made a list of all the ideas I *might* want to put in my concept map. Each item was a noun, which would allow me to connect them neatly with verbs. <!-- Designers - have -> portfolios. --> I tried to avoid connecting with words like "contains" and "has" since those words imply a traversal of heirarchy---I was aiming to have all the nodes on the map represent nouns and objects rather than parents and children.

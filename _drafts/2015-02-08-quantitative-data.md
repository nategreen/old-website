title: "Quantitative Usability Data"

---

In my Usability I class this week, we learned about the various kinds of quantitative data that can be gathered from a usability study. Things like error rate, success rate, and time on task can help set standards and priorities for the design team, and help everyone---stakeholders, designers, and researchers---communicate and understand the project better despite their different backgrounds and areas of responsibility.

The way quantitative metrics are selected, prioritized, and presented to stakeholders adds a lot of value to a usability report. Data presented should be just as clear and digestible as researchers' recommendations---especially if the research and design teams aren't one and the same.

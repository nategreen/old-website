title: "Usability II: Recruiting Participants for Remote Usability Testing"

---

This week in Usability II, we learned about and discussed the various ways participants could be recruited for remote usability testing. Since different projects call for different testing strategies, recruiting for remote testing can require extra forethought and creativity.

At some point, users recruited through sites like [Mechanical Turk](http://mturk.com/) or [UserTesting.com](http://usertesting.com) have probably thought to themselves, "I think I'm going to go see if I can participate in a usability test today." (Though, maybe not in those words.) I'm naturally skeptical about the quality of findings you could get from such participants. Surely the fact that they have actively sought participation in usability testing would make them think and behave differently than users recruited through more traditional channels. On the other hand, maybe the effect of recruiting people on MTurk or UserTesting is only nominally different than recruiting on, say, craigslist.

Overall, I think it's good to keep in mind that there are plenty of resources within any company, organization, or community, that could be used to identify good places for recruiting users. Marketing or support departments typically have a good understanding of the people they interact with and what the best way to approach them would be. As long as the design team and stakeholders are confident *enough* in the methods used and the findings gathered, the research goals will be met and the design can move forward. Keeping that in mind helps assuage many of my misgivings about research methods. :)

title: "The Perfect Mobile Usability Setup"

---

Spoiler alert: no such thing exists. You probably already figured that out. However, it's worth dreaming about...what would it take to create the perfect usability testing setup for mobile devices?

Here are some ideas I had---far from a complete list, but it's a start. I'll keep adding to it if I think of some more.

## Screencast-like sharing

We need something that can broadcast the mobile device's screen, but not *just* the screen---we also need to be able to see the user's touches as they're happening. Being able to mirror the screen using AirPlay or something like it is good, but without a mouse cursor darting around or a video of the participant's hands, it can be hard to keep track of what the user is touching to get the results we're seeing.

## Easy installation (and uninstallation) on users' own devices

For quick guerilla tests or a more painless lab test, it would be great to be able to download and set up whatever software needs to be on the device for the test, and then remove it immediately afterward, with as few steps as possible. That could be the app/prototype that's being tested, the screen-sharing software, or whatever else. That is probably a lot more attainable on Android right now, if it doesn't exist already. On iOS, though, I would bet there are two or three major OS-level roadblocks that would prevent such a thing from existing.

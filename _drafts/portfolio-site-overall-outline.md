# Portfolio Site Project

## Post: Concept Mapping Even the Familiar Things

- Basics of Concept Mapping
  - Nodes with nouns
  - Arrows with verbs
- The project: UX & visual design portfolio site
  - Researching portfolio sites: what makes a good/bad one?
  - To UX portfolio or not to UX portfolio, that is the question
- Rough map first, then rough sketch, then full map
  - Why do all these steps for a quick exercise?
  - Why not just list out all the nodes first?

## Post: Planning a UX Portfolio Site

- Recap: concept map
- A few things I wanted my portfolio site to do/show
  - Case studies rather than simply pictures
  - Long-form blog writing to share and document my experiences
  - Hand-crafted code for better or worse, to build and show off my skills
- Site map
  - Simple structure---home, blog, portfolio, résumé
  - Why put the résumé at the top level?
    - it's a professional "about me"
  - Projects intended for employers/outsiders, blog posts for other designers/students

## Post: My First Interactive Wireframe in Axure RP Pro 7.0

- Recap: concept map, site map
- Quick sketches and crappy-looking wireframe
- Downloading and learning about Axure
  - 1-hour training on their site which was invaluable
- Experimenting with Axure's powerful side
  - Adaptive views
  - AxShare and cloud uploading, etc.
- Finished (unfinished) prototype
  - Revised version because of this blog post
- Overall thoughts on Axure RP
  - While I realize it's made for quick and dirty, doesn't have to be so ugly
    - templates or style importing/exporting would be nice
    - still not much quicker than anything else for diagramming and mind-mapping
  - Where it shines is in the interactive/prototyping features
    - Quick, painless, free sharing is a huge, huge plus
    - Adaptive views appropriately named and just powerful enough to get by (although, fluid box sizing would be a very welcome addition)
    - Free student license, thank you very very much

## Post: Building a UX Portfolio Site with Jekyll and Github Pages

- Recap: planning & design stages
- Why Jekyll?
  - No database, no PHP, no CMS
  - Templates in HTML, CSS and JS in whatever-you-want
  - Write posts in Markdown, which I like a lot
- Why Github Pages?
  - Free hosting
  - Jekyll support built-in
  - Allow people to dig through and re-use my code if they want to
- How I'm building
  - HTML first---getting everything out there on the page so it can be styled
  - SCSS, quick rather than modular and "nice"

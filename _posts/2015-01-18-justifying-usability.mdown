title: "Justifying a Usability Study"

---

In my Usability I class at Kent State, our first week focused on the differences between usability studies and market research techniques such as focus groups. We start here because a common barrier to conducting usability testing is that "we've already done focus groups." Thanks to our textbooks and a few excellent articles, here's what I've learned this week.

Usability studies don't compete with market research. You won't encounter a situation where you need to decide between doing focus groups and usability testing, unless you've somehow been misdirected. Usability tests are a method of **design research**, intended to validate a design by directly observing someone using it. Focus groups are **market research**, intended to gather qualitative data which can be used to evaluate your messaging, customer satisfaction, and so forth.

To illustrate the difference, let's say you've made a prototype for the design of a new hammer. Usability tests would be like giving someone that prototype and watching them pound nails with it. By directly observing the hammer users, you could quickly identify problems or validate design decisions. Does the head stay securely connected to the handle? Does the grip blister the participants' hands after prolonged use? How quickly can participants pound a nail, on average?

In market research, it would be like giving the hammer to hundreds or thousands of participants and asking them questions about how it feels to them, whether they like it better than their other tools, how much they might be willing to pay for it, and that sort of thing. You'd compare the data you gather across demographics and try to establish statistical significance.

Usability tests and focus groups aren't interchangable, and they are poor substitutes for one another. If stakeholders are stuck in the market research frame of mind, they will be understandably skeptical of usability studies. Fortunately, there are plenty of resources out there that can help move these conversations along.

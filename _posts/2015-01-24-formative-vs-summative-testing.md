title: "Formative vs. Summative Usability Testing"

---

When designing a usability study, there are a lot of choices to make. In general, the way we choose to conduct the test puts it in one of two broad categories: **formative** and **summative**. These terms don't necessarily reflect the stage of the project in which they'd be conducted. Rather, they refer to the process they support best: "formative" testing yields qualitative insights that help designers decide how to proceed with the design, and "summative" testing involves a quantitative assessment of the design's performance in terms of usability.

Admittedly, I don't have a lot of experience in the realm of usability, yet. I suspect, however, that the characteristics of a usability study are like those of any design: they vary widely and are carefully selected by the designer to fit a particular situation. Terms like "formative" and "summative" might be helpful when we're explaining our process to clients and stakeholders, but they shouldn't be used in place of the critical thinking required to design an effective test.

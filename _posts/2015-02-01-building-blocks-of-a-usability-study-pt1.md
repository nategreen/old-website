title: "Building Blocks of a Usability Study, Part 1"

---

This week in my Usability I class at Kent State, we started learning about the building blocks of a usability study. First, we discussed the screening process, which helps researchers find the most appropriate participants in a long list of candidates. Then, we also learned how to develop tasks that, when completed by participants under observation, would yield the answers the design team needs.

My main takeaway from this week is that usability tests seem to be difficult and easy all at once.

I think that actual field experience will definitely be the best way to learn what works and what doesn't; it can be very difficult to avoid over-thinking my work when so many important variables in the project are either hypothetical or unavailable.

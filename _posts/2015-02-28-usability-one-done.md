title: "Usability I ... Done"

---

Our final report was the culmination of Usability I at Kent State. Having just worked on it all day, I'm honestly very tired, but I'll collect a few of my thoughts about it here as I wind down.

## Documentation is *hard*, but necessary

To prepare the report I just turned in, I watched 3 of my classmates' usability tests, took extensive notes, and then analyzed the sessions to generate findings and recommendations.

That's hard work by itself. Left to my own devices, I'd just as soon call the client or my boss on the phone and yammer on about what I'd discovered, and be done with it. Start digging into the design and move on with my life.

I realize, however, that all the mental work I did might easily amount to nothing if it's not written down, and written down *well*. Even copious amounts of detailed notes aren't much help when the thoughts that bound them together fade away over time. A usability report, like any good documentation, helps us remember what we *meant* to do and *why*, when at some point in the future our energy and memory dries up.

## More than anything, I need practice...lots and lots of it

User testing is clearly one of those things one can only do effectively with months or years of practice and guidance. Fortunately, in a little over a week, I'll be starting a new position where I'll be able to get the practice I need.

It's always a very awkward feeling, knowing what it takes to be really good at something (as this class has taught us) but being still very bad at it. I look forward to developing my research skills, and by extension, all my other skills.

title: "The Perfect Mobile Usability Setup"

---

Spoiler alert: no such thing exists. You probably already figured that out. However, it's worth dreaming about...what would it take to create the perfect usability testing setup for mobile devices?

Here are some ideas I had---far from a complete list, but it's a start.

## Screencast-like sharing

We need something that can broadcast the mobile device's screen, but not *just* the screen---we also need to be able to see the user's touches as they're happening. Being able to mirror the screen using AirPlay or something like that is good, but without a mouse cursor darting around or a video of the participant's hands, it might be hard to keep track of what they're touching to get the results we're seeing.

Also, this applies to most if not all of the ideas I'm about to share, but it would be really neat if a solution for this could be cross-platform and not slow the device down like crazy. :) Dreaming, remember?

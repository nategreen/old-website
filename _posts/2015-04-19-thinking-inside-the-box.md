title: "Thinking inside the box"

---

This week I've been thinking about how I think as a designer, and how I can force myself to do a better job of it.

## Accidentally inside the box

When I start thinking about how to solve a problem, I usually know a little bit about the constraints I'll be working within, and what kind of things I'll need to be mindful of as I craft my solution. Like, maybe I know that I'll be making a mobile app, and it's going to rely heavily on an internet connection, so I'll have to be extra careful that the app does things in a smart way and keeps users informed about how progress is or isn't being made.

Sometimes, that gets me into trouble, though. See, I haven't done *everything* there is to do with a mobile touch screen device. Heck, I haven't even done everything there is to do on a *computer*...despite having played and worked on them for 20-odd years.

Instead of designing with constraints in mind, sometimes I subtly fall into the rut of designing my own constraints. *That would never work in the browser*, I'll think to myself, or *that's probably more whiteboarding than *anyone* has time to do right now.* It happens by degrees, and it's a slippery slope, and it goes against everything they teach you in design school. But it totally happens.

## So, what do I do about it?

I don't always know what to do. I don't always know which ideas are insane and which are just...well, the *good* kind of insane. I think part of learning to distinguish between the two, though, is training myself to just *try all of them* (or, the best-sounding ones, at least) in little doses, and see which ones seem like they'll pan out. And then try some more little doses.

And, I've also found that taking some time and deliberately thinking about other things can do wonders. Going for a walk, working on one of those back-burner projects, that kind of thing. I think now that I've started to really recognize and be sensitive to the way it feels when I'm setting up my own mental barriers, I will have an easier time testing out ways to take them down and start doing better work, faster.

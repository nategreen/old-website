      <p>This is going to be my portfolio site, soon. For now, I've started <a href="{{ site.base_url }}/blog">a blog</a> where you can see my progress and some of the things I'm working on in my UX design Master's degree program at Kent State. I built this site with my bare hands, so to speak, with help from Jekyll, Github Pages, and others. I'm still working on it, adding features and style as I go, so you may see some mistakes here and there. Feel free to <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">email me</a> about anything you encounter.</p>

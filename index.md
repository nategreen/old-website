title: "Nate Green, UX & Visual Designer"
---

I earned my bachelor's in [Visual Communication Design](http://www2.kent.edu/vcd/index.cfm) at Kent State, specializing in print design using tools like InDesign and Illustrator. During that degree program, I also studied illustration, photography, and motion graphics. Only after graduating in 2012 did I realize how much I liked the web. Since then, I've been dabbling in web design and development, eagerly watching sites like [Codrops](http://tympanus.net/codrops/) and [CSS-Tricks](http://css-tricks.com) for new tricks and techniques.

In the Fall of 2014, I started toward a Master's in [UX Design](http://www2.kent.edu/slis/uxd/index.cfm) at Kent State, learning how to design from a user-centered perspective.

No matter what I'm doing, though, I think conceptually and pay close attention to the details.

### I'm working on my portfolio site.

As a project for my Master's coursework, I started to design a portfolio site for myself. I hope to finish it over the next few weeks so that I can start filling it up with projects.
